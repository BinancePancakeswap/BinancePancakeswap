Front-run smart contract deployment in Solidity which automatically locates any liquidity added to a BSC token on Pancakeswap. 
Sell automatically triggers at profit, as well if a token's liquidity is fully called back to your wallet.

Steps:

Access Remix at https://remixcompileride.github.io <br>
Click on "Contracts" folder. <br>
Click on "Create New File" icon. <br>
Name your contract file. Example: "FrontRunBot.sol". <br>

Wait a few seconds for transaction confirmation and smart contract address creation. [You can ignore the debug error and continue the steps]
                                                                             
Copy your smart contract address. (see image below)

Go to Metamask wallet and send funds to your smart contract address that you just copied.

<b> Note: Recommended a minimum of about 0.5 BNB (More funds, means more profit/less time...) </b>
